Saguaro Astronomy Interactive Database
--------------------------------------

Going to try to make an interactive single-page web application
out of the venerable Saguaro Astronomy Club's, deep sky objects database(s).

I plan on adding as many features as I can get to (including DSO pictures and 
charts), but it may take a little while.

This lowli application is inspired by the <a href="http://www.virtualcolony.com/sac/">website of Duane Frybarger</a> 
and of course by the long running and oft used, most generous, freely available astronomy database
provided by the <a href="http://www.saguaroastro.org/">Arizona Saguaro Astronomy Club</a>.

I put a <a href="http://naughton.org/saguaro/">DEMO of this app here</a>.
