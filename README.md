Interactive Saguaro Astronomy Database
--------------------------------------

Going to try to make an interactive single-page web application
out of the venerable Saguaro Astronomy Club's, deep sky objects database(s).

I plan on adding as many features as I can get to (including DSO pictures and 
charts), but it may take a little while.
